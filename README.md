## Introduction

K-Talk is a real-time chat application that demonstrates the use of Java WebSockets and JSPs for building a dynamic messaging system. This application allows multiple users to chat simultaneously in a browser-based environment with support for day/night themes, real-time updates, and a neat interface styled with pastel colors and emojis.

This project was developed as part of academic coursework at NFSU, and serves as an introduction to real-time Java-based web applications.

## üîç Simple Detailed Breakdown

### `ChatServer.java`
- Acts as the WebSocket backend.
- Handles connections, incoming messages, and broadcasting.
- Annotated with `@ServerEndpoint("/chat")`.

### `chat.jsp`
- The main chat UI rendered via JSP.
- Includes HTML structure with username form, chat box, user list, and day/night toggle.

### `script.js`
- Establishes WebSocket connection with `ChatServer.java`.
- Sends and receives JSON-based messages.
- Updates the chat DOM in real-time.

### `web.xml`
- Defines welcome page (`chat.jsp`) and servlet context.
- Initializes JSPs in Tomcat on startup.
